# Tokenomics

Pirate Gold (PGLD) is the game coin.

It can be used to buy ships or items. And can be changed into crypto currency as well.

## Supply

The PGLD has a limited supply of 21 000 000 (21 millions coins, like bitcoin).

## Minting

PGLD is minted every time a treasure is found.

The daily minted amount is caped and determined by the exponential decay formula. Meaning that treasure value (reward) depends on how many users have started a hunt on the same day...

## Exchange

PGLD collected from ships and items sales is put on sale on a DEX on a daily basis.
