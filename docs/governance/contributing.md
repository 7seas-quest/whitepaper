**Seven Seas** is designed, built, run, maintained and promoted by contributors.

Most contributors come from [inside|app](https://www.insideapp.fr) at the moment, but anyone, once approved, can become a contributor.

## Tasks

Here is a non exhausive list of tasks carried out by contributors:
- Gameplay design
- UI/UX design
- Smart contract development
- Backend development
- Frontend development (apps)
- Project management
- Community management
- Marketing and promotion

## Rewards

Every contributor is rewarded with PGLD tokens for time spent working on the project.

The hourly rate is **600 PGLD**.

Contributors are responsible of keeping track of completed tasks, along with hours spent working on them.

To get rewarded, they can issue a reward proposal to the DAO, describing their work and the expected reward amount.

?> Contributor can use the [Contributor Reward Proposal Template](governance/proposal_templates/contributor_reward_template.md) to fill their proposal.

## Expenses

Contributors sometimes need to pay for tools or resources to complete their tasks, and they can get a PGLD compensation for that.

The expenses compensation rate is **100 PGLD for $1**.

As for rewards, expenses compensations can be claimed with a DAO proposal.

?> Contributor can use the same template as for rewards to claim expenses: [Contributor Reward Proposal Template](governance/proposal_templates/contributor_reward_template.md).
