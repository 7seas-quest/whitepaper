## Geolocation anti-spoofing system

In order to prevent geolocation cheating, the anti-spoofing system checks:
- The move speed of the player between his/her starting point and treasures / wrecks, and in between teasures and wrecks.
- When checking for an acutal location, the game system also relies on the smartphone health data, to be sure a move was detected.
