# Crew

A crew starts with at leat one pirate.

However, in order to maximze rewards, users can increase their crew size (and then cumulate pirate skills). But in order to do that they need to buy ships.

## Ships

Ships are NFTs that can be bought by users with PGLD.

Ships skills are:
- Speed
- Armament
- Capacity

Speed and Armament affect the game mechanics as Capacity gives the maximum crew size.

If a user has more pirates that his/her ship capacity he/she can modify his/her crew composition in between each treasure hunt.

He/she can also sell or trade pirates that he/she does not use.

## Items

A crew overall skills can be enahnced by buying items.

Like ships, items are NFTs that can be bought using PGLD.

As an example: buying a telescope improves the crew navigation skill.
