In order to play, players must own at least one pirate.

Each pirate has base skills that affects the crew capabilities.

Players can get pirates by minting them.

Minting is done "randomly" giving every player the same chance to get a super skilled pirate (or not...).

## Start a treasure hunt

</p>

To find a treasure, players have to physically move to the geographical location of the treasure as indicated on a map.

A treasure has an expiration time: the player has to find it before it expires.

When treasures expire, the player has to wait until he/she can start a new hunt to get new ones to find.

## Get rewarded

</p>

Players get rewarded with PGLD and PRBT (Pirate Rum Bottle Token) everytime they physically reach a treasure location.

PGLD and/or PRBT can be used to increase the crew skills and capabilities (with ships and items) or can be cashed out (PGLD only).
