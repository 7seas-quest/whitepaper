## Solo hunt

In a solo hunt, users have to find treasures that only them can see.

When a user wants to play he/she needs to explicitly start a solo hunt.

A solo hunt can be started when :
- his/her previous solo hunt already ended
- the crew had enough rest since the previous hunt. This rest time varies according to the crew skills

A solo hunt ends when all tresures expire.

When starting a solor hunt , the game system spawns several treasures around the user the location, and everytime he/she reaches this physical location he/she is rewarded with PGLD.

While moving towards treasure locations users may discover ship wrecks containing pirates and / or PGLD coins.

Users can see treasures on their map, but not ship wrecks.

## VS hunt

In VS hunt mode, have to find the same treasures, and the first reaching the location wins all the PGLD (winner takes all).
