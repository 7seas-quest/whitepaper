## Solo hunt

In a solo hunt, users have to find treasures that only them can see.

When a user wants to play he/she needs to explicitly start a solo hunt.

A solo hunt can be started when :
- his/her previous solo hunt already ended
- the crew had enough rest since the previous hunt. This rest time varies according to the crew skills

A solo hunt ends when all treasures expire.

When starting a solo hunt , the game system spawns several treasures around the user location, and everytime he/she reaches this physical location he/she is rewarded with PGLD.

While moving towards treasure locations users may discover ship wrecks containing pirates and / or PGLD coins.

Users can see treasures on their map, but not ship wrecks.

## VS hunt

In VS hunt mode, users have to find the same treasures, and the first reaching the location wins all the PGLD (winner takes all). The VS hunt treasure value is greater than the solo hunt treasure.
