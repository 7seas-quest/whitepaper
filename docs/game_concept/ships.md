Ships are NFTs that can be bought by players with PGLD and PRBT.

## Seasons

Ships NFTs are gathered into collections (Smart Contracts) named "seasons".

Each season provides a set of ships, and each ship has a variable mint occurrence according to its skills (the best the skills are, the rarest the pirate is).


## Skills

Ships skills are:
- Speed
- Armament
- Capacity

Speed and Armament affect the game mechanics as Capacity gives the maximum crew size.

If a player has more pirates that his/her ship capacity he/she can modify his/her crew composition in between each treasure hunt.

He/she can also sell or trade pirates that he/she does not use.

## Types

Ships can be be of different types.

The ship type as an incident on its caracterics. 

Some types are more common than others (gen occurrence).

| Type       	| Capacity 	| Speed  	| Armament 	| Gen occurrence 	|
|------------	|----------	|--------	|----------	|-----------------	|
| Sloop      	| 4-6      	| 10-100 	| 10-60    	| 10              	|
| Schooner   	| 5-10     	| 10-90 	| 10-70    	| 7               	|
| Brigantine 	| 10-15    	| 10-80 	| 15-100   	| 3               	|
| Frigate    	| 15-20    	| 10-75  	| 20-100   	| 2               	|

## Rarity level

Like pirates, ship types have rarity levels. The rarest a ship is, the best its skills are.

Ships skill point are speed and armament.

| Level     | Sum of skill points | Mint occurrence|
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Common    | 40                  | 100            |
| Rare      | 70                  | 50             |
| Epic      | 95                  | 10             |
| Legendary | 175                 | 1              |


For example if the season has 4 common ships, 3 rare ships, 2 epic ships and 1 legendary ship, the sum of occurrences are:

$4 * 100 + 3 * 50 + 2 * 10 + 1 = 571$

Meaning that a player has :
- a chance out of 571 to get a common ship
- 20 chances out of 571 to get an epic ship
- 150 chances out of 571 to get a rare ship
- 400 chances out of 571 to get a common ship

If mixed with ship type, the sum of occurences are:

$571 * 10 + 571 * 7 + 571 * 3 + 571 * 2 = 12 562$

Meaning that a player has :
- 2 chances ( 1 * 2) out of 12 562 to get a legendary Frigate
- 30 chances (3 * 10) out of 12 562 to get an epic Brigantine
- 1000 chances out of 12 562 to get a common Sloop
