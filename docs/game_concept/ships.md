Ships are NFTs that can be bought by players with PGLD.

Ships skills are:
- Speed
- Armament
- Capacity

Speed and Armament affect the game mechanics as Capacity gives the maximum crew size.

If a player has more pirates that his/her ship capacity he/she can modify his/her crew composition in between each treasure hunt.

He/she can also sell or trade pirates that he/she does not use.
