## Seasons

Pirates NFTs are gathered into collections (Smart Contracts) named "seasons".

Each season provides a set of pirates, and each pirate comes as a limited edition where the supply varies according to his skills (the best the skills are, the rarest the pirate is).

## Rarity level

Each season contains pirate of diffrent rarity levels. The rarest a pirate is, the best his skills are.

| Level     | Sum of skill points | Mint occurence |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Common    | 100                 | 100            |
| Rare      | 150                 | 50             |
| Epic      | 250                 | 10             |
| Legendary | 350                 | 1              |

For example, if a season has 4 common pirate, 3 rare pirate, 2 epic pirate and 1 legendary pirate, the sum of occurences are:

$4 * 100 + 3 * 50 + 2 * 10 + 1 = 571$

Meaning that a player has :
- a chance out of 571 to get a lengendary pirate
- 20 chances out of 571 to get an epic pirate
- 150 chances out of 571 to get a rare pirate
- 400 chances out of 571 to get a common pirate

Pirates are defined by a set of physical attributes and a set of skills.

Physical attributes do not affect the game mechanics, but skills do.

Skills are :
- Navigation
- Combat
- Strategy
- Mercy

They range from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum) and have an impact on different actions during a hunt.
