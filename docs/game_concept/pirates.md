## Seasons

Pirates NFTs are gathered into collections (Smart Contracts) named "seasons".

Each season provides a set of pirates, and each pirate comes as a limited edition where the supply varies according to his skills (the best the skills are, the rarest the pirate is).

## Mint price

A pirate is minted with the host blockchain coin.

The mint price is calculated according to the PGLD current value: the higher the PGLD value is, the higher the mint price is.

## Attributes and skills

Physical attributes do not affect the game mechanics, but skills do.

Skills are :
- Navigation
- Combat
- Strategy
- Mercy

They range from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum) and have an impact on :
