A crew starts with at least one pirate.

However, in order to maximize rewards, players can increase their crew size (and then cumulate pirate skills). But to do that they need to buy ships.

A crew is composed of:
- Pirates
- A ship (optional)
- Items

The crew size (number of pirates on the crew) is limited to 20, which is tle maximum capacity for a ship in the game.

A player can only have one crew, but can change it as needed.

## Setup

A player cannot start a treasure hunt without a crew. He / she needs to explicitly assign at least one pirate to the crew.

A ship can be added to the crew to enroll more pirates (depending on the ship capacity size).

The crew can be updated between treasure hunts. For example: the player can replace a pirate, or use another ship.

Eventhough a crew has a limited capacity, a player can own as many pirates, ships and items as desired.

## Skills

Crew skills are the added skills values of each pirate, ship skills and every item skill enhancement.

As an example, a crew with the following setup :
- Pirate #1 (navigation: 42, mercy: 74, strategy: 34, combat: 53)
- Pirate #2 (navigation: 81, mercy: 23, strategy: 61, combat: 72)
- Ship (speed: 48, armament: 23, capacity: 4)
- Item #1: telescope (navigation + 12)
- Item #2: black sail (speed + 11)

Has the following crew skills :
- navigation: 135
- mercy: 97
- strategy: 95
- combat: 125
- speed: 59
- armament: 23
- capacity: 4
