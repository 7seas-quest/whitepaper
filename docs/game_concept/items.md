A crew overall skills can be enhanced by buying items.

Like ships, items are NFTs that can be bought but with PRBT only.

As an example: buying a telescope improves the crew navigation skill.

## Seasons

Item NFTs are gathered into collections (Smart Contracts) named "seasons".

Each season provides a set of items (along with pirates and ships), and each item as a variable mint occurence.

## Types and rarity level

Items can be of diffrent types.

Each item type adds point to a specific crew skill.

Like other game objects, items have a rarity level.

| Type / Rarity level | Common         | Rare            | Epic            | Legendary       |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Telescope           | Navigation + 5 | Navigation + 10 | Navigation + 15 | Navigation + 20 |
| Extra Sail          | Speed + 5      | Speed + 10      | Speed + 15      | Speed + 20      |
| Big Gun             | Armament + 5   | Armament + 10   | Armament + 15   | Armament + 20   |
| Voodoo Doll         | Strategy + 5   | Strategy + 10   | Strategy + 15   | Strategy + 20   |
| Parrot              | Mercy + 5      | Mercy + 10      | Mercy + 15      | Mercy + 20      |
| Magic Apple         | Combat + 5     | Combat + 10     | Combat + 15     | Combat + 20     |


| Level     | Mint occurence |
|-----------|----------------|
| Common    | 100            |
| Rare      | 50             |
| Epic      | 10             |
| Legendary | 1              |

As each item type exists for all rarirty level, the player has:
- 1 chance out of 161 to get a legendary item
- 10 chances out of 161 to get an epic item
- 50 chances out of 161 to get a rare item
- 100 chances out of 161 to get a common item

## Max items per crew

The number of available slots depends on the capacity skill of the ship. A new slot is unlocked every 4 capacity skill points.

As an example: 

| Ship Capacity | Slot items |
|---------------|------------|
| 0 to 3        | 0          |
| 4 to 7        | 1          |
| 8 to 11       | 2          |
| 12 to 15      | 3          |
| 16 to 20      | 4          |
