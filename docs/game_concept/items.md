A crew overall skills can be enhanced by buying items.

Like ships, items are NFTs that can be bought using PGLD.

As an example: buying a telescope improves the crew navigation skill.

## Slot Items 

The number of available slots depends on the capacity skill of your ship. You unlock a new slot every 4 capacity skill points.

As an example: 

| Ship Capacity    	| Slot items 	   |
|-------------------|------------------|
| 0 to 3            | 0            	   |
| 4 to 7      	    | 1                |
| 8 to 11    	    | 2    	           |
