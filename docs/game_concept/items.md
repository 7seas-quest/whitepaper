A crew overall skills can be enhanced by buying items.

Like ships, items are NFTs that can be bought but with PRBT only.

As an example: buying a telescope improves the crew navigation skill.

## Seasons

Item NFTs are gathered into collections (Smart Contracts) named "seasons".

Each season provides a set of items (along with pirates and ships), and each item as a variable mint occurence.

## Types and rarity level

Items can be of diffrent types.

Each item type adds point to a specific crew skill.

Like other game objects, items have a rarity level.

| Type / Rarity level | Common         | Rare            | Epic            | Legendary       |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Telescope           | Navigation + 5 | Navigation + 10 | Navigation + 15 | Navigation + 20 |
| Extra Sail          | Speed + 5      | Speed + 10      | Speed + 15      | Speed + 20      |
| Big Gun             | Armament + 5   | Armament + 10   | Armament + 15   | Armament + 20   |
| Voodoo Doll         | Strategy + 5   | Strategy + 10   | Strategy + 15   | Strategy + 20   |
| Parrot              | Mercy + 5      | Mercy + 10      | Mercy + 15      | Mercy + 20      |

## Max items per crew

The number of available slots depends on the capacity skill of your ship. You unlock a new slot every 4 capacity skill points.

As an example: 

| Ship Capacity    	| Slot items 	   |
|-------------------|------------------|
| 0 to 3            | 0            	   |
| 4 to 7      	    | 1                |
| 8 to 11    	    | 2    	           |
| 12 to 15    	    | 3    	           |
| 15 to 20    	    | 4    	           |
