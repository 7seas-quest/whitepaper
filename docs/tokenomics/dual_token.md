The game works on a dual token system:
- The Pirate Gold Token (PGLD) is the value token of the game
- The Pirate Rhum Bottle Token (PRBT) is the in-game utility token used to materialize player engagement

Players need at least one pirate to start earning PGLD and PRBT, however as the PGLD rewards depend on the crew size and skills, PRBT rewards are the same for every player.

Both tokens are used to mint new features for the crew:
- PGLD and PRBT are required to mint a ship
- PRBT only is required to mint new crew items

!> Pirates however can only be minted with the blockchain coin.

Such a dual token mechanism ensures a balance between early game players and new comers:
- Early players need to stay involved in the game n order to progress
- New comers can keep a descend progression path without the need to pay too much
