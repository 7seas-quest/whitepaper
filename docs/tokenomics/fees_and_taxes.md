At the moment, the game does not charge any fee, and reward distribution is directly charged to the game.

## Network fees

In order to run, blockchains use a gas system to reward network validators.

Network fees are necessary to execute transactions (write operations) on the blockchain.

The gas price varies over time, as it mostly depends on network usage.

Player is only subject to network fees when minting a ship or item.

?> When minting a new pirate from the app, the payement system checks the player wallet balance, and if necessary, sends a few MATIC as subsidy for network fees.
