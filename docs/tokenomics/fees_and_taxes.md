In order to run, the game charge player with fees and taxes.


## Network fees

In order to run, blockchains use a gas system to reward network maintainer.

Network fees are necessary to execute transactions (write operations) on the blockchain.

The gas price varies over time, as it mostly depends on network usage.

Player is only subject to network fees when minting a pirate, ship or item

?> Reward distribution is directly charged to the game

## Mint tax

Every time a player mints a pirate, a ship or an item, a tax of **3%** is taken from the mint price.

This tax is used to:
- Finance the game development and maintenance 
- Reward the game creators, investors and contributors

Example: if a pirate is minted for a price of 10, the tax is 0.3. The rest (9.7) is put in the game, mostly for reward distribution.
