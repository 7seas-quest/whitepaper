In order to run, the game charge player with fees and taxes.


## Network fees

In order to run, blockchains use a gas system to reward network validators.

Network fees are necessary to execute transactions (write operations) on the blockchain.

The gas price varies over time, as it mostly depends on network usage.

Player is only subject to network fees when minting a pirate, ship or item

?> Reward distribution is directly charged to the game

## Mint tax

No mint tax is planned so far. All collected coins will be sent to the treasury contract, for later dispatch.
