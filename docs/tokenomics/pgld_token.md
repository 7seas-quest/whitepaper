Pirate Gold (PGLD) is the value token.

It can be used to mint ships. And can be changed into crypto currency as well.

## Supply

The PGLD has a limited supply of **21 000 000** (21 millions tokens, like bitcoin).

## Minting

All the PGLD supply is minted on launch day, but unlocked following a vesting schedule.

?> See [Token distribution](tokenomics/token_distribution) for more details.

## Usage

PGLD is used to reward players.

A share of the PGLD tokens are put in a reward pool contract following a vesting schedule (see [Token distribution](tokenomics/token_distribution)).

PGLD go out of the reward pool when:
- A treasure is found
- A ship wreck is found

PGLD go into the reward pool when:
- New PGLD are unlocked from the vesting schedule
- New ships are minted by players

?> In a near futur, PGLD will be used to take more actions during the game. See [Future concepts](game_concept/future_concepts).
