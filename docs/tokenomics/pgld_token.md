Pirate Gold (PGLD) is the value token.

It can be used to mint ships. And can be changed into crypto currency as well.

## Supply

The PGLD has a limited supply of **21 000 000** (21 millions tokens, like bitcoin).

## Minting

Minting is controlled by the game DAO. However 50% of the total supply will be allocated to the game on launch day.

?> See [Token Distribution](tokenomics/token_distribution) for more details.

## Usage

PGLD is used:
- to reward players
- to buy ships (along with PRBT)
- as DAO governance token

A share of the PGLD tokens are put in a reward pool contract following a vesting schedule (see [Token distribution](tokenomics/token_distribution)).

PGLD goes out of the reward pool when a treasure is found.

PGLD collected for ships and items sales is sent to the DAO treasury.

## Listing

On game start PGLD token will be listed on Uniswap Decentralized Exchange (DEX) at the initial price of **$0.01**.

The amount of PGLD initially listed will be decided by the DAO on the same day (will depend of pre-launch sales).
