## Intended audience

Eventhough, **Seven Seas** is a Web3 game, the app was designed to make it almost invisible to the players with features such as social login support (Google, Apple, and Discord are supported), in-app purchase, and network fees subsidies (so that players don't need to get to an exchange to buy cryptocurrency).

?> Note: advanced Web3 players can also login by providing their own seed phrase.

## Mission

**Seven Seas** is a game, and does not pretend to save the world, fight the climate change or serve any higher purpose.

The goals of the game are simple and clear:
1. Have fun
2. Be challenging
3. Earn money

Note that earning money comes third. For a simple reason: the game needs to be sustainable. Which means:
- A balanced model instead of unsustainable ROI promises
- An affordable entry cost and less financial pressure on newcomers
- Fair fees

Finally, the game also aims at becoming a game onwed by its contributors and its players, through its PGLD token.
